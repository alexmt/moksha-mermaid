  subtitle: Embodied, collaborative therapy grounded in presence and care
  description: |
    You're welcome to bring your spiritual questions and curiosities about altered states, creative process, grief, longing, and the experiences that feel too tender or too strange to share elsewhere.
    I blend grounded clinical training with intuitive, relational presence.
    My approach is embodied and process-oriented as I integrate mindfulness, expressive arts, parts work, somatic attunement, and existential inquiry shaped by your unique story and needs.
    We begin where you are.
    
    I see symptoms as signals your system is doing its best to protect you. Our time together is collaborative—holding space for your story to unfold in your own timing and language, whether through words, silence, movement, art, or metaphor.
    Together we’ll explore new ways to feel grounded, supported, and more like yourself. Resources might include:

    * Somatic practices to help regulate and reconnect with your body
    * Exploration of spiritual or existential questions
    * Parts work, shadow work, or inner child healing
    * Mindfulness, imagery, and nervous system education
    * Open, warm dialogue that honors the unspeakable
    * Gentle space for grief, rage, sadness, and ambivalence to be felt, expressed, and integrated without urgency or judgment

    Our time together is about cultivating space where your deeper knowing can emerge. Our sessions are portals, not pathologies, to what is alive, aching, or emerging.
    My practice holds space for expansive human experience, including exploration of sexuality, intimacy, and the transformative potential of non-ordinary states of consciousness.

    I use a blend of therapeutic modalities, and more than anything, I use my presence, curiosity, courage, and connection.
    I listen with my whole self—for what is said, and what trembles just beneath it. We may sit in silence, move our bodies, draw, question, grieve, laugh, scream, or name the unspeakable.
    I work from the belief that healing undfolds in relationship with ourselves, each other, and the world around us.
    Sessions are co-created spaces where complexity is honored, language is not over-relied upon, and stillness, ambiguity, or rage can all be a part of the medicine.
    The process is collaborative and approached with reverence and care.
- name: Who I Serve
  subtitle: Sensitive, spiritually curious people through grief, transition, trauma, and identity change with affirming care
  description: |
    I work with individuals navigating transitions, grief, identity shifts, and spiritual disorientation.
    Many of my clients are seekers—people who feel deeply, think expansively, and often feel like they don’t quite fit in.
    Those who feel the ache of the in-between, awakening to their aliveness, unsettled by change, or carrying grief with nowhere to place it.
    You may be working through trauma, anxiety, burnout, or relationship challenges.

    You may feel stuck in survival mode or longing for a more authentic life. You may not know what’s wrong—only that something’s asking to change because more is possible.
    My practice is affirming of all identities, with a focus on supporting LGBTQ+, neurodivergent, highly sensitive, creative, and spiritually curious folks.
    Some are healing from childhood wounds that shaped their capacity for fluidity, expression, or relational safety.
    Others are deconstructing rigid beliefs, transforming, and reclaiming parts of themselves that had to go underground.

    You're welcome to bring your spiritual questions and curiosities about altered states, creative process, grief, longing, and the experiences that feel too tender or too strange to share elsewhere.
    If you’ve ever felt “too much,” “not enough” or like you're becoming someone you don’t recognize—you're in the right place.
    All bodies and ways of knowing are welcome. All of you is welcome here.
- name: What to Expect
  subtitle: Sessions are warm, relational, and paced with care, supporting your whole self through change and healing
  description: |
    Your first few sessions will focus on getting to know each other, understanding your goals, spoken or unspoken, and building a foundation of trust.
    I offer a warm, compassionate space where you can bring your full self—your confusion, your contradictions, your grief, your longing.

    You can expect:
    * Spaciousness and adaptability
    * Moving at your pace
    * Deep attunement and presence
    * Support for navigating uncertainty, transition, or grief
    * Space to explore identity, spirituality, or relational wounds
    * A gentle invitation into the intelligence of your body and soul
    * Collaborative reflection and meaning-making
    
    This is therapy as soul-tending. It’s not always linear, but it is always relational. You don't have to go it alone.

    You are welcome to bring all parts of yourself here—including the parts that feel too wild, too quiet, too curious, or too much.
    Conversations around intimacy, sexuality, altered states, and psychedelic experiences are not just permitted—they are sacred invitations into deeper healing and truth.

- name: How I Work in Organizations
  subtitle: Relational, systems-aware consultation that supports individuals and teams in cultivating clarity, resilience, and more humane ways of working together
  description: |
    In professional spaces, we often unconsciously repeat familiar relational patterns—shaped by early environments, identity, and cultural systems.
    These dynamics can limit collaboration, creativity, and well-being, especially under chronic stress or invisible power imbalances.

    My approach to individual and team environments invites greater awareness of how we show up in relationship—with ourselves, our colleagues, and the larger organizational field.
    Together, we identify habitual survival strategies—like over-functioning, people-pleasing, avoidance, or control—and explore how they may impact leadership, decision-making, or team connection.
    With gentle attention to nervous system regulation and communication style, individuals build greater resilience, clarity, and capacity to respond rather than react.

    This work is especially supportive for diverse workplaces navigating neurodivergence, identity-based marginalization, or complex group dynamics.
    We explore how to move through conflict, feedback, and change with more curiosity and care—attending to both interpersonal nuance and systemic influence.
    Whether you're leading a team, building a mission-driven organization, or simply seeking to align your work with your values, our work together cultivates grounded presence, thoughtful discernment, and sustainable impact.
