- name: Somatic & Trauma-Informed Therapy
  subtitle: Grounded support for healing trauma through the wisdom of the body.
  description: |
    This work centers the body as a primary site of healing, helping you move out of survival mode and into greater regulation,
    presence, and choice. Trauma often lives beneath language, shaping how we relate, protect, and perceive safety.

    Through somatic attunement, mindfulness, and nervous system education, we gently track sensation, impulse, and emotion as they arise in real time.
    Sessions may involve slowing down, noticing subtle shifts, or practicing resourcing that builds capacity rather than overwhelm.
    I take a non-pathologizing approach that honors symptoms as intelligent adaptations, not failures.

    Together, we work to restore a sense of agency, embodiment, and trust—allowing your system to release what it no longer needs while strengthening your ability to stay present with what is alive now.
    Healing unfolds at your pace, in relationship, with care and consent.

- name: Depth, Identity & Relational Work
  subtitle: Exploring identity, relationships, and the parts of you shaped by history and longing.
  description: |
    This offering supports those navigating identity shifts, relational wounds, grief, or a sense of becoming someone unfamiliar.
    Drawing from parts work, attachment theory, and depth psychology, we explore the inner landscapes shaped by early relationships,
    culture, and systems of dominance.
    
    Many clients come feeling "too much", fragmented, or unsure where they belong.
    Our work creates space for disowned or exiled parts to be met with curiosity rather than judgment.
    We attend to relational patterns as they arise between us, using the therapy relationship itself as a site of healing.

    This is a collaborative process that honors complexity, contradiction, and change.
    Over time, clients often experience increased self-compassion, relational clarity, and a felt sense of wholeness that makes new ways of being possible.

- name: Spiritual, Existential & Integrative Therapy
  subtitle: Holding space for meaning-making, spiritual inquiry, and the mystery of becoming.
  description: |
    This work is for those experiencing spiritual disorientation, existential questioning, or a longing for deeper meaning.
    I welcome conversations about spirituality, sexuality, creativity, altered states, and non-ordinary experiences as sacred dimensions of healing.

    Sessions may include imagery, ritual sensibility, expressive arts, silence, or inquiry into what feels ineffable or unnamed.
    Rather than offering answers, I help you listen to what is emerging from within—what is asking to be grieved, remembered, or reimagined.

    This approach honors both intellect and mystery, structure and spontaneity. Therapy becomes a portal for reconnecting with purpose, aliveness, and inner guidance.
    The work is spacious, relational, and reverent, supporting a return not just to functioning, but to a sense of meaning, coherence, and belonging within yourself and the world.
