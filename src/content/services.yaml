    My work blends grounded clinical training with intuitive, relational presence.
    My approach is embodied and process-oriented as I integrate mindfulness, expressive arts, parts work,
    somatic attunement, and existential inquiry shaped by your unique story and needs.
    Our sessions are collaborative and non-pathologizing. I hold space for your story to unfold in your own timing and language—whether through words, silence, movement, art, or metaphor. I don’t “fix” or analyze from afar; I witness, reflect, and accompany. Sessions might include:
    * Somatic practices to help regulate and reconnect with your body
    * Exploration of spiritual or existential questions
    * Parts work, shadow work, or inner child healing
    * Mindfulness, imagery, and nervous system education
    * Open, warm dialogue that honors the unspeakable

    Our work isn’t about arriving somewhere quickly—it’s about cultivating space where your deeper knowing can emerge.
    Our sessions are portals, not pathologies, to what is alive, aching, or emerging.
    My practice holds space for expansive human experience, including exploration of sexuality, intimacy, and the transformative potential of non-ordinary states of consciousness. 
    I use a blend of therapeutic modalities, but more than anything, I use my presence, curiosity, courage, and connection.
    I listen with my whole self—for what is said, and what trembles just beneath it.
    We may sit in silence, move our bodies, draw, question, grieve, laugh, or name the unspeakable.
    I work from the belief that healing undfolds in relationship—with ourselves, each other, and the world around us.
    Sessions are co-created spaces where complexity is honored, language is not over-relied upon, and stillness, ambiguity, or rage can all be a part of the medicine.
    The process is collaborative and approached with reverence and care.
- name: Who I Serve
  subtitle: Sensitive, spiritually curious people through grief, transition, trauma, and identity change with affirming care.
  description: |
    I work with individuals navigating transitions, grief, identity shifts, and spiritual disorientation.
    Many of my clients are seekers—people who feel deeply, think expansively, and often feel like they don’t quite fit in.
    Those who feel the ache of the in-between, awakening to their aliveness, unsettled by change, or carrying grief with nowhere to place it.
    You may be working through trauma, anxiety, burnout, or relationship challenges.

    You may feel stuck in survival mode or longing for a more authentic life. You may not know what’s wrong—only that something’s asking to change because more is possible.
    My practice is affirming of all identities, with a focus on supporting LGBTQ+, neurodivergent, highly sensitive, creative, and spiritually curious folks.
    Some are healing from childhood wounds that shaped their capacity for fluidity, expression, or relational safety.
    Others are deconstructing rigid beliefs, transforming, and reclaiming parts of themselves that had to go underground.

    If you’ve ever felt “too much,” “not enough” or like you're becoming someone you don’t recognize—you're in the right place.
    All bodies and ways of knowing are welcome. All of you is welcome here.

- name: What to Expect
  subtitle: Early sessions are warm, relational, and paced with care, supporting your whole self through change and healing.
  description: |
    Your first few sessions will focus on getting to know each other, understanding your goals (spoken or unspoken), and building a foundation of trust. I offer a warm, compassionate space where you can bring your full self—your confusion, your contradictions, your grief, your longing. Therapy with me is spacious and adaptive; it moves at your pace.
    You can expect:
    * Deep attunement and presence
    * Support for navigating uncertainty, transition, or grief
    * Space to explore identity, spirituality, or relational wounds
    * A gentle invitation into the intelligence of your body and soul
    * Collaborative reflection and meaning-making
    This is therapy as soul-tending. It’s not always linear, but it is always relational. You don't have to go it alone.

    You are welcome to bring all parts of yourself here—including the parts that feel too wild, too quiet, too curious, or too much.
    Conversations around intimacy, sexuality, altered states, and psychedelic experiences are not just permitted—they are sacred invitations into deeper healing and truth.
