  I am a fellow traveler on the path of personal and collective transformation,
  committed to holding space for the full complexity of being human.

   I trust the intelligence of the body, psyche, and the unseen, honoring places of erotic aliveness, grief, longing,
   and spiritual inquiry as gateways to healing.

  My work is less about fixing and more about tending—to the soul, the unlived life, and what is quietly trying to bloom. 
  Grounded in trauma-informed, relational, and somatic practice, I witness with reverence, curiosity, and care.
